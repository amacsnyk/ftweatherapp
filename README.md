# FT Weather App

_“Build a website that shows the real-time weather for a location of your choice”_

Mission: Possible!

## Requirements

✅ **Display real-time weather for your location**: when you first visit the site, it geolocates you and serves up the weather for your location :earth_africa: 
✅ **Allow you to choose the city you get weather for**: once the first page with local weather is loaded, you can search for any city :city_sunrise: 
✅ **Doesn't rely on client-side frameworks and libraries**: no jQuery or React involved :+1:

## Extras

✅ **It's accessible**:
* I used semantic HTML elements as much as possible
* The color scheme (tested with the Chrome colorblinder extension) is high contrast and is still readable with many types of colorblindness
* The window immediately focuses to the search input, and :hover and :focus elements give a bright blue outline to let the user know they are selected.

✅ **It's responsive**: using a grid (or rather, o grid :eyes:) made the layout responsive for all sizes of screen  
✅ **It uses Origami components**: after reading about some of the Origami components used at the FT, I chose to use:
* o-typography: to keep the typography clean and cohesive
* o-grid: usually I'm a flexbox fan, but the idea of a ready-built responsive grid model seemed too good to pass up.

✅ **It's built using JS and Node, and is server-side rendered**: using Express as the Node framework, and Handlebars as the templating engine
✅ **It's deployed to Heroku**: which you can see [here!](https://ftweatherkb.herokuapp.com/)
